supports many different drivers and types
volumes are not neccessarily persistent
volumes survuve container restarts but not necessarily pod restarts
Normal volumes are dependent on pods and their lifecycle
Defined with the pod spec
Emptydir: most basic type of volume, data is inconsistent as it creates emptiy dir per pod

hostpath: path on host machine and exposed to multiple pods, consistent data but if multiople hosts then issue

CSI: container storage interface, quite flexible volume type
