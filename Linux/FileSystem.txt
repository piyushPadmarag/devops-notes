Filesystem is a system by an operating system to manage files.

Os stores files and dir in an organized and structured way

/boot: dir that contains booting/boot loader files (ex: grub.cfg)

/root: root user home dir. It is not same as /

/dev: system devices like keyboard,speaker, pen drives

/etc: configuration files 

/bin (for new versions: /usr/bin): everyday user commands

/sbin (/usr/sbin): system/filesystem commands

/opt: optional add on apps(not part of standard os)

/proc: running process(only exist in memory)

/lib(/usr/lib): c programming library files needed by commands and apps 

/tmp: temporary files

/home: dir for user

/var: system logs directory 

/run: system daemons that starts very early to store temporary runtime files ex: PID files 

/mnt: to mount external filesystem 

/media: for cdrom mounts
