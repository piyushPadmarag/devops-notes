A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of characters in a search.

ex: 

* represents zero or more character 
? represents a single character
[] represents a range of characters
\ (slash): as an escape character
^ (caret): beginning of a line
$ end of line  

 touch piyush{1..4}-padmarag
 
 rm piyush*

 ls -l ?iyu*

  ls -l *[yr]* | more

  -------------------------------------inode-softlink-hard link--------------------------------------

  inode: pointer or a unique number of the file on the hard disk. contains metadata of the file like permission,size,type etc 

  soft link: it is like a shortcut to the original file or dir. if file is renamed or removed, it will be 
             removed. it will have different inode no 
             ex: lrw-w-x (l represents soft link)
             cd target-destination 
             ln -s /home/piyush/pp.txt (path of the source file)

  hard link: it is like copy of the file. deleting or renaming or moving the original file will not affect
             the hard link. it will have same inode number. hard link works within the same partition of disk
             ex: 
             cd target-destination 
             ln /home/piyush/pp.txt (path of the source file)

Note: you cannot create soft or hard link within the same dir with the same name. That is wwhy we will create links in 
        /tmp dir.
