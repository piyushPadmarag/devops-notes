Lifecycle of a containeR:

The complete lifecycle of a docker container revolves around five phases:

Create >>> Running >>> Paused /unpause >>> Stopped >>> Killed 


Docker ----> Container D -----> run C ----->container 
                -                               ^
                -                               ^
                -----------> shim---------------^


container D: creates and launches containers 
            maintainence, monitoring of lifecyxle 
            sub-process of docker


Shim: The moment containeR starts run c brcomes inactive but before that it creates shim.
      Run c hands over all activity to shim and shim keeps the health info of container. 

Control Group: when we create a container, it has RAM, processor, storage etc. These are 
                all provided by Control group
