Identity: is a representation of a person, app or a device
          usually requires a password or certs or a secrets to prove

Identity management is done by azure active directory, now entra. 

Active directory and entra are not exact replcement of each other. 

AAD focus more towards on prem and entra towards cloud.

Entra ID handles authentications for applications using token based auth.

Benefits: Security
          Reduced development time as Entra will handle auth
          Easier support
          additional features like looking for login pattern with AI to check for fraudster
          Centralised administrator
          single sign on 
          integrated with other azure services

authentication VS Authorization:

authentication is user providing who they are (login id password)

Authorization is ensuring the user is permitted to perform a certain task(role based auth)

Entra ID conditional access: Not all attempts to login are equally safe. 
                            Ex: someone loggin in from an unknown or not used location.
                            someone who suddenly logs in after much time 

Passwordless authentication: Iris, face,fingerprint etc
