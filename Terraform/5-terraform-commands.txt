terraform validate:
    we use this command to check if the syntax is correct or not.

    Validate runs checks that verify whether a configuration is syntactically valid and 

    internally consistent, regardless of any provided variables or existing state.
    
    Usage: terraform validate

terraform init: 
    The terraform init command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. 

    This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. 

    shows the version of the plugin being installed, 
    downloaded in .terraform/plugin in the work dir containing config files 

Terraform plan:
    The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, 
    which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure.

    By default, when Terraform creates a plan it:

    Reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date.

    Compares the current configuration to the prior state and noting any differences.

    Proposes a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration.

    The plan command alone does not actually carry out the proposed changes
  
Terraform apply:
   The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.

    When you run terraform apply without passing a saved plan file, Terraform automatically creates a new 

    execution plan as if you had run terraform plan, prompts you to approve that plan, and takes the indicated actions. 

Terraform destroy:
    The terraform destroy command is a convenient way to destroy all remote objects managed by a particular Terraform configuration.

Terraform show: 
    to see the configuration details of the resources created by apply comaand.
    It inspects the state file and displays the details.
